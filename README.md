# DoraHacks UI Engineer Test Assignment

The color choice of the navigation menu is based on the DoraHacks logo colors: black, white, and orange. I am using an orange circle, which I see as representing the sun, for the hover animation, and I have added a shadow effect to the submenu.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
